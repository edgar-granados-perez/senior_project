This repository will contain all files and notes related to my senior project: Identifying genes to predetermine pre-eclampsia.
 
 Proposition:
    - Through the use of web scraping I will gather specific information from the research papers(high blood pressure and obesity) in pdf file type which I will then use OCR to gather text such as “title”, “author”, “year”, and “abstract” to insert a table which is then parsed out into a word cloud that will highlight key terms of the text. 
      Then create a data model that will allow me to validate or deny an article that can be used for filtering articles into an array of select genes. Then this array will be compared to data sets of individuals with Pre-Eclampsia.
