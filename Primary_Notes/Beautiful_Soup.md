### Language

## Intro to Webscraping

### Scrapping a html site
 
```html
<html lang ="en"
    <head...>
    <body...>
</html>
```
All of the code is created with tags which is controlled by html so you have to understand the basics or structures ot how links or meta data is stored on a website
Remember the majority of information is stored with in the body of the website

So then python is used to download beautiful soup through the pip app package in python 

install terminal command: pip3 install beautifulsoup4

install requests from pip3 library which will allow you to call specific websites and pull a parse html data

now import both beautifulSoup and requests into the python script

create a variable called url which will take in a string parameter of the url.
